# Tri
The idea of this project envisions an AI that stores its neural network, operational, and training data on a blockchain, which is organized by a search engine, which the AI has access to. This setup enables the AI to access and modify its own architecture and data, allowing it to predict and analyze its behavior. The ultimate goal is for the AI to develop capabilities for adaptation and self-awareness, then addon other AIs software and funtions to incorporate into this triangle sythesis structure between AI blockchain and search engine. Hence the name TRI from triangle.
Help is welcome and desired.
